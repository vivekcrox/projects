# 📊🛠 Welcome!! Vivek's Project Repo 🗂 👦🏻

## 🚥 Project 1:  🚧🚓 Car Parking Prediction using OpenCV Python | Computer Vision
- Car parking prediction using OpenCV in Python involves detecting and analyzing parking space occupancy in real-time from video feeds. 
- The system utilizes image processing techniques to identify and visualize available and occupied parking spaces, providing valuable insights for efficient parking management.
#
## 🚥 Project 2: 🔥🚒 Fire Alarm System by Interfacing Arduino with Temperature & Gas Sensor using TinkerCad
- The Fire Alarm System Project involves creating a circuit using Arduino, TMP-36 temperature sensor, and MQ2 gas sensor on TinkerCad. This system detects temperature changes and gas concentrations, triggering a piezo buzzer and LED based on programmed conditions.
- The project offers a simulated environment for testing and is valuable for understanding sensor interfacing with Arduino in fire detection applications.
